We recognize data teams have unique needs. K12 Analytics Engineering offers two flexible pricing models to address them.

Our hourly rate pricing works well for organizations that are looking to have us augment their data team. We collaborate closely and help where helpful. Do you need help writing SQL to produce datasets for report cards or state data collection? Count us in! Is your queue of dashboards to build making your head spin and you need some help? We're here for you! No project is too big or too small!

Our annual plan is perfect for skilled BI developers and analysts who excel in their BI platform. We provide the data pipelines and warehouse, and you create insightful dashboards for your team.

## Annual Pricing

Our annual pricing model is based on the number of students in your organization.

| Student Count &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; | Annual Cost |
| --------------------- | :----: |
| 0 - 5,000             | $55,000.00  |
| 5,001 - 7,500          | $65,000.00  |
| 7,501 - 10,000         | $75,000.00  |
| 10,001 and up         | $85,000.00  |


Regardless of which option you choose, you'll receive a managed data platform customized to your specific requirements.
