<Accordion title="What happens to my data warehouse should I choose to lead K12 Analytics Engineering?">
We believe in building data infrastructure that is long lasting and impactful to the organization even if we are no longer the maintainer of the infrastructure. While we hope to work with you for a long time, should you choose to leave K12 Analytics Engineering, we would be happy to move all ingestion infrastructure and data warehouse into a Google Cloud organization that you own.
