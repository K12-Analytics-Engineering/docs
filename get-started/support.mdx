We are available to answer your questions during business hours: **Monday through Friday, 8am to 5pm Central Time**.

We have a Slack instance so our community can reach out to each other for thought partnership and collaboration. Your team will be added to a private channel so you can chat us any time you have a question, suggestion, and need some additional engineering support.

We aim to respond to all inquiries within **1-2 business days**, prioritizing urgent requests with a **3-hour response time** whenever possible. Resolution times may vary depending on your issue's complexity, but the team strives to address them promptly and maintain an average resolution time below **five business days**.
