K12 Analytics Engineering is a managed data platform that brings all of your organization's information together in a central data warehouse.  This isn't just a storage locker for your data - it's specifically designed for K12 organizations.

We provide you with data marts built around assessment, attendance, discipline, enrollment, grades, and more. Our warehouse focuses on structuring data such that you can report on current data as well as historical trends. In short, K12 Analytics Engineering's data warehouse saves you time and effort by making it easy to ask and answer the questions that matter most to educators.

Our data warehouse is built in Google BigQuery which means it can be used in any of the major BI platforms such as Google Looker Studio, Tableau, Power BI, Lightdash, and more.
