K12 Analytics Engineering's data warehouse integrates data from your various data sources into comprehensive, longitudinal datasets ready for analytics. We believe a data warehouse should integrate data sources such that they represent your organization and not be source system specific. This means a student grades dataset that encompasses gradebook, transcript, and LMS grades or an assessment dataset that encompasses assessment data from across your various platforms.

Are you using an edTech platform not represented below? That is okay! As long as your vendor offers some type of data out (API, ODBC, SFTP), we'd be happy to build an integration for you at no additional cost.
